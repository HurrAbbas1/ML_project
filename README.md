INTRODUCTION
Analysis of urine sediment is a cornerstone in the diagnostic workup of renal and
urinary tract diseases. Traditional manual microscopy, while effective, is often
time-consuming, requires specialized expertise, and can be subject to inter-
observer variability. This project, &quot;AI-Powered Urine Sediment Analysis,&quot; aims to
leverage advanced artificial intelligence to provide an accessible, user-friendly
tool for the automated classification of particles in urine sediment images and to
offer preliminary diagnostic insights. By utilizing a powerful multimodal AI model,
this application serves as an educational and supportive tool, enhancing
understanding and potentially aiding in preliminary investigations.
OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to develop an intuitive web application
that harnesses AI to analyze uploaded urine sediment images. The specific goals
include:
1. Automated Particle Classification: To enable users to upload urine
sediment images and receive AI-driven classification of various particles
(e.g., Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Epithelial Cells, Casts, Crystals,
Bacteria), complete with confidence scores and visual bounding box
annotations on the image.
2. Preliminary Diagnostic Insights: To provide potential diagnostic
suggestions (e.g., Urinary Tract Infection, Hematuria) based on the AI&#39;s
interpretation of the uploaded image, accompanied by confidence levels
and explanations.
3. Educational Morphology Resource: To offer a comprehensive, easily
navigable section detailing the morphological characteristics, AI
differentiation points, and diagnostic significance of common urine
sediment particles.
4. User-Friendly Interface: To ensure all functionalities are presented through
a clean, modern, and responsive user interface, making the tool accessible
to a broad audience, including students and researchers.
5. Wellness Support (Auxiliary): To provide a supplementary health
dashboard where users can log moods and receive general wellness tips,
promoting a holistic approach to health awareness.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manual urine sediment analysis, a critical diagnostic procedure, presents several
challenges:
 Time Intensive: It requires significant time from trained laboratory
personnel.
 Subjectivity: Particle identification and quantification can vary between
observers.
 Expertise Dependent: Accurate interpretation often relies on experienced
microscopists, who may not always be readily available.
These factors can lead to delays in analysis and potential inconsistencies. &quot;AI-
Powered Urine Sediment Analysis&quot; addresses these issues by:
 Providing a platform for rapid, AI-assisted particle classification from
uploaded images.
 Offering standardized, AI-generated insights that can complement
traditional methods.
 Serving as an educational tool to help users visually identify and understand
the significance of various urine sediment components, thereby
democratizing access to this knowledge.
METHODOLOGY
The &quot;AI-Powered Urine Sediment Analysis&quot; application is built using a modern
web stack and integrates with a cloud-based generative AI model.
1. System Architecture:
 Frontend: Developed using Next.js (React framework) with TypeScript for
type safety. User interface components are built with ShadCN UI and styled
with Tailwind CSS. Lucide React is used for iconography.
 AI Integration: Genkit, an open-source AI framework, is utilized to interact
with Google&#39;s Gemini, a multimodal AI model capable of processing image
and text inputs.
 Backend Logic: Next.js Server Actions are used to handle communication
between the client-side application and the Genkit AI flows.

2. Core Functionalities:
 Image Upload &amp; Pre-processing (Client-Side):
o Users upload images (PNG, JPG, etc.) via a standard file input.
o The image is converted to a base64 data URI on the client-side for
transmission to the AI model.
 AI-Powered Particle Classification:
o The classifyParticlesFlow (a Genkit flow) receives the image data URI.
o A specifically engineered prompt instructs the Gemini model to
identify various urine sediment particles, estimate confidence for
each identification, and provide normalized bounding box
coordinates for detected particles.
o The flow returns a structured JSON object (defined by a Zod schema)
containing the list of classified particles and their attributes.

 AI-Powered Diagnostic Suggestion:
o The diagnoseDiseaseFlow (a Genkit flow) also receives the image
data URI.
o Its prompt guides the Gemini model to analyze the overall visual
features of the sediment image and suggest potential
conditions/diseases relevant to urinalysis, along with confidence
scores and brief explanations.
o This also returns a structured JSON output.
 Frontend Display:
o Classified particles are listed with their confidence scores.
o Bounding boxes are rendered dynamically as overlays on the
previewed image, using the normalized coordinates provided by the
AI, scaled to the displayed image size.
o Diagnostic suggestions are presented clearly, often using card-based
layouts.

 Morphology Information Page:
o Static, detailed information about different particle types is
presented in a tabbed layout for easy navigation and learning. Each
particle section includes descriptions of features, sample images
(placeholders), AI distinction notes, and diagnostic significance.

 Health Dashboard:
o Allows users to log their mood using a form (date, mood selection,
notes).
o Displays general wellness tips, which can be filtered based on the
logged mood.

3. Data Handling:
 Input (image data) and output (classification/diagnosis results) for AI flows
are structured using Zod schemas to ensure type safety and consistency.
 Image data for diagnosis on the separate diagnosis page is temporarily
passed via localStorage.
Note: This application utilizes pre-trained generative AI models (Gemini via
Genkit) and does not involve training or fine-tuning machine learning models
within the application itself. The &quot;intelligence&quot; comes from prompting these large
foundation models.

EXPECTED OUTCOME
The &quot;AI-Powered Urine Sediment Analysis&quot; project is expected to deliver:

diagnostic suggestions.
2. An intuitive user interface that clearly presents analysis results, including
visual annotations (bounding boxes) on images.
3. An educational resource (Morphology Page) that enhances users&#39;
understanding of urine sediment particles.
4. A demonstration of how modern generative AI models can be integrated

purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or
advice.
CONCLUSION
The &quot;AI-Powered Urine Sediment Analysis&quot; project successfully demonstrates the
integration of advanced multimodal AI into a user-friendly web application for the
analysis of urine sediment images. By providing automated particle classification
with visual annotations and preliminary diagnostic insights, it serves as a valuable
educational and research tool. While not intended to replace professional medical
judgment, this application showcases the potential of AI to augment traditional
methods, improve understanding of complex medical data, and provide accessible
preliminary insights. The modular design using Next.js and Genkit lays a
foundation for future enhancements and exploration in AI-assisted medical
informatics.
